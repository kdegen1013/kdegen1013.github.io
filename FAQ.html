<p><strong>What is a triathlon?</strong> A race with swim + bike + run disciplines.</p>

<p><strong>Who is Cal Tri Events?</strong>&nbsp; Cal Tri Events is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization with a safe, affordable &amp; accessible mission.&nbsp; Learn more at Triathlete Magazine, Endurance Business &amp; The New York Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Does Cal Tri Events really have 14 event options per race? Yes with the rare exception, Cal Tri Events offers 14 events options. 7 Olympic distance events (Triathlon, Triathlon Relay, RunBikeRun, SwimBike, SwimRun, 1640 Yard Swim &amp; 10K Run) and 7 Sprint distance events (Triathlon, Triathlon Relay, RunBikeRun, SwimBike, SwimRun, 400 yard Swim &amp; 5K Run). Triathlon Relay is 2 or 3 athletes combined to complete the triathlon.</p>

<p><strong>How long are the races?</strong> Cal Tri Events produces short course triathlons at the sprint and Olympic distances. Always refer to the race page for specifics, but typically distances are as follows:<br />
Sprint: 400 yard swim, 8-16 mile bike, 3.1 mile run.<br />
Olympic: 1640 yard swim, 24.8 mile bike (as close as possible), 6.2 mile run</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m a beginner, can I do this?</strong> Absolutely! Depending on your age and health, it&rsquo;s a good idea to get a physical from your doctor before embarking in endurance sports. With your doctor&rsquo;s endorsement you&rsquo;ll want to prepare by swimming, biking and running to prepare for your race. Choose a distance that is realistic for your condition and experience with the three disciplines of triathlon (see: What are the different lengths of triathlon?).</p>

<p><strong>What are some of the things I need to bring?</strong> These are some of the items you will want to have in your transition bag.</p>

<ul>
	<li><u>Swim</u> - Triathlon shorts &amp; top, goggles and a wetsuit depending on the water temperature. A latex swim cap will be provided.</li>
	<li><u>Bike</u> - A bike with two wheels with brakes on each wheel.&nbsp; A helmet. A tire change kit. A water bottle.</li>
	<li><u>Run</u> - Running shoes, hat/visor and race belt for the running bib (will be provided). Safety pins will be available at registration.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What does Cal Tri Events provide in the athlete packet?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Cal Tri Events Wristband.&nbsp; Put this on immediately. Only athletes with wristbands will be allowed to enter the transition area.</li>
	<li>Cal Tri Events Bike Sicker. Place the sticker on the top tube of your bike between the seat and the handlebars.</li>
	<li>Cal Tri Events Run Bib. This will only be worn during the run portion of the triathlon. If you don&#39;t have a race belt, safety pins can be secured at registration.</li>
	<li>Cal Tri Events/Blueseventy Swim Cap. Every athlete with a swim event must wear the swim cap.&nbsp; They are allowed to wear another swim cap below the official swim cap</li>
	<li>Cal Tri Events Participant Shirt. Athletes who register one month in advance of the race will have their name printed on the back of the race shirt.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Cal Tri Events Finisher Medal.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How does a seeded, rolling swim work? </strong>Swim starts have evolved from mass swim starts to seeded, rolling swim starts as a safety enhancement. Seeded, rolling swim starts are designed to minimize athlete contact in the water. Athletes are allowed to enter the water in groups of 2-4 at a time in intervals of 3-5 seconds.&nbsp; Athlete order into the water is seeded from fastest to slowest swimmer shortly before the race. The athlete must know their 100 yard swim pace for their event. An athlete&#39;s time only starts when they cross the timing mat.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Do I need a wetsuit? </strong>Not all races require a wetsuit. If the water is 78 degrees or cooler, you can wear a wetsuit (but it&rsquo;s not required). If the water is 78-84 you can wear a wetsuit but you won&#39;t qualify towards awards. There are various types of triathlon wetsuits: full wetsuits, sleeveless and buoyancy shorts. There are also wetsuits for surfing or boating. These also work, but are not specifically designed for the demands of triathlon specific swimming.</p>

<p><strong>What type of bike can I use? </strong>An expensive bike is not necessary. A bike with two wheels with brakes on each wheel. Road, mountain, hybrid, gravel and triathlon bikes are allowed.&nbsp; Fixie and recumbent bikes are not allowed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Can I use headphones?</strong> <span style="color:#FF0000;"><u><strong>NO</strong></u></span>. Athletes need to maintain situational awareness. Headphones are not allowed. Athletes using headphones will be asked to return them to their transition area before continuing their race.</p>

<p><strong>What is a relay triathlon? Do we all get timing chips? </strong>A relay triathlon is when 2 or 3 athletes combine to complete the triathlon. Each individual will complete one or two of the disciplines. Relay athletes meet in the transition area. Each get a race bib but there&rsquo;s only one timing chip and that goes to the team administrator. That timing chip gets passed along through the course of the day.</p>

<p><strong>Is body marking required?</strong> No. A lot of old school races require writing the athlete&#39;s race number or age on their calf, shoulder or hand.&nbsp; The Cal Tri Events wristband does everything needed without the need of a Sharpie.</p>

<p><strong>How do I know where to put my bike in transition?</strong> Unless directed otherwise, athletes are free to chose any place in transition to rack their bike. Be mindful of other athletes and try to not take up too much room.</p>

<p><strong>Will there be traffic on the bike course?</strong> Some courses are partially or completely closed to traffic and others are partially or fully shared with traffic. A closed course is a course that is not open to traffic. You won&#39;t have to worry about vehicles, but you still have to watch out for other participants, cyclists or walkers/runners. A shared course will have vehicles on the course. Ride defensively. Watch out for cars pulling out of small streets or driveways.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Are athletes responsible for knowing the course?</strong> Athletes are responsible to study and know the course. We highly recommend that athletes familiarize themselves with the bike and run course by driving or riding it prior to the race if possible. Police are there to keep an intersection open for cyclists.&nbsp; They are not there to provide directions.</p>

<p><strong>How does a SwimBike work? </strong>A SwimBike event includes only swim and bike disciplines. The athlete is finished when they return their bike to transition.&nbsp; Athletes can then leisurely walk to transition and get their time.</p>

<p><strong>How does a SwimRun work?</strong> A SwimRun event includes only swim and run disciplines. The athlete must place their run gear in the transition area for use after the swim. The event starts at the swim start and finish under the finish arch.</p>

<p><strong>How does a RunBikeRun work? </strong>A RunBikeRun event includes a run, bike, then another run. The event starts at the finishing arch, includes a transition to the bike in the transition area with race completion under the finishing arch after the run.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Does Cal Tri Events do overall awards? Age group awards?</strong> Overall awards to the top 3 (Male &amp; Female) for each of the 14 events will be presented. There are no age group awards. Consistent feedback from our community is that athletes would rather spend time with family and friends than endure a lengthy age group award ceremony with 560 possible podium presentations (14 events x 20 age groups x 2 (M/F).</p>

<p><strong>How does Cal Tri Events recognize age groups winners? </strong>The Grand Prix USA Series Competition returns with over 30 races across the U.S.&nbsp; A total of 130 athletes will be recognized (Top 5 Overall Male, Top 5 Overall Female &amp; 120 Age Group).&nbsp;In 2021, over $10,000 worth of prizes will be awarded.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Athletes who successfully complete 2 scored events are eligible for series awards. Athletes who participate in more events have their 2 BEST scores count.</li>
